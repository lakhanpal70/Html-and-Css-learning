        /* With the CSS box-sizing Property
The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height: */
      

/* 

.div1 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.div2 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;  
  padding: 50px;
  border: 1px solid red;
  box-sizing: border-box;
} */


/* Without the CSS box-sizing Property
By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:

width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element

This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appears bigger than you have set (because the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height).

The following illustration shows two <div> elements with the same specified width and height:


 */.div1 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
}

.div2 {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 50px;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
span{
    border: 2px solid greenyellow;
    height: 200px;
    font-weight: 200   px;
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 15px;
    /* After Applying display: block;:
The <span> now behaves like a block-level element.
It takes up the full width available within its parent container. */
    display:inline-block ;
}

        /* div{
            border: 50px solid rebeccapurple;
            margin: 25px;
            width: 250px;
            height: 250px;

<!-- Can inline span tag be changed in block  -->
 <!-- Default Behavior: Normally, <span> is an inline element, meaning it only takes up as much width as its content needs and doesn't start on a new line.
After Applying display: block;:
The <span> now behaves like a block-level element.
It takes up the full width available within its parent container.
Each <span> starts on a new line, with the second span appearing below the first. -->


    <!-- INLINE BLOCK : -->
     <!-- display: inline-block;

Combines features of both block and inline elements.
Takes up only as much width as necessary but allows you to set height and width.
Does not start on a new line.
